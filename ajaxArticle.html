      <h1>Can this Ajax team go all the way?</h1>
      <div id="author">By: Hamza Mohammed</div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">What at first seemed like a dream is starting to become reality for the young dutch team. This team, objectively, has been the most vibrant, entertaining side in Europe. The young core gives them a swagger that the rest of the teams left in the compeititon can't compete with. Only one obstacle remains in their to the road to the final: Tottenham Hotspur. In this blogpost, I answer the question whether or not they can win the prestigious trophy.<br><br>
      This is the first time Ajax have made it past the semi-finals in almost two decades. So this is obviously a big deal for the fans and the team. And this is in no way a fluke. This young Ajax team had a surmountable obstacle to overcome, two giants in the world of football - Real Madrid and Juventus. I think it's crucial to understand just how young this Ajax side is, the average age of players is 21. The stars that shone the brightest are the caption De Ligt and Tusic.<br><br>
      Ajax will face one of the two remaining English clubs in the semi final. Currently, three English teams remain in the competition but with Tottenham and Manchester City going head-to-head on Wednesday, only two will remain. Ajax will face one of either Manchester City or Tottenham and if they can come through that, they will take on either Barcelona or Liverpool in the final. So, although they've had a tough road behind them they also have a tougher road ahead.<br><br>
      Can they reach the final? Of course, they have a great shot of continuing this unbelievable run, but to win it would require something truly extraordinary. If they can pull that off with a squad this young, this inexperienced and up against so many of the world's best, it would have to go down as one of the greatest sporting feats of the modern day.
