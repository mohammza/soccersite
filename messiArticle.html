      <h1>The Brilliance of Messi and Barcelona</h1>
      <div id="author">By: Hamza Mohammed and Mohammed Hamza</div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Barcelona move onto the semi-final after failing to do so the past 3 years after a win over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer side. Man Utd failed to score over both legs of the quarter-final, and were completely dominated by this Barca side. As Barcelona get ready for their semi-final match against an offensiive-oriented Liverpool, I think it's time to bring the comparison of this Barcelona side to Guardiola's Barcelona that swept all the trophies in 2011-2012. That Guardiola side is what made me fall head over heels in love in the beautiful game. The way the ball would be moved across the pitch with fluidity and grace, it was second to none. This brings me to Ernesto Valerde's Barcelona, the stlye and philosophy they play with <br><br>
      Valverde's Barcelona is one described by many as rigid and direct, this description of Barcelona is a stark contrast from Guardiola's Barcelona. In his first season, Valverde implemented a direct tactic, making the side tight at the back and creating a stoically defensive unit. The club scored many goals, but none of them exuded the brilliance that is normally expected of Barcelona, conceding the second-lowest number of goals. Ernesto Valverde’s tiki-taka is not the classical style of play which is completely in line with the club’s philosophy. In Valverde’s version, the ball is moved about with much more urgency and thus, a debatable flaw of tiki-taka, pointless passing, is avoided. Antoher important point to mention which is the crux to this Barcelona side, it is the role of Lionel Messi. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Messi is one of the.... no, the best player to ever grace the pitch. These past few seasons, he has shown the world exactly why. Whilst Messi played a 'false 9' position in Guardiola's Barcelona, in this current side Messi has evolved and taken on the role of a midfielder. He is undoubtedly the play-making cortex of the Barca brain. In the few times he hasn't scored started games it was very noticeable that the Barcelona side was lacking 'pizzaz' on the attack end. I have much more to speak about the brilliance of Messi but I'll save that for another blogpost. <br><br>
      This brings me to the comparison of Valverde's side to Guardiola's. Although the technique and elegance Guardiola's Barca displayed was unrivalled, Valverde has managed to come in fix the gaps in defense which Barca have had under the past two managers - even under Guardiola. Not fixing defense gaps but bringing in more depth to the squad. This side are no longer concerned with unbridled free-flowing attacking football yet they have enough quality to control possession and territory without ever leaving themselves defensively exposed. There is more greater power and athleticism in this side than in previous editions. Having said this, I still don't think this Barca side is better than the Barca of old. That 2011-12 Barca, in my humble opinion, was the opitime of football. The Barca of style made millions of fans fall in love with football... The beautiful game.
