      <h1>Ronaldo and Co. Crash Out</h1>
      <div id="author">By: Mohammed Hamza</div>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Much of the focus after the loss was on Juve’s Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo who had won the last three the Champions League tournaments his former club, Real Madrid. Juventus specifically bought the forward from the Spanish giants last summer for a transfer fee of 100 million euros ($113 million), in the hope he could once again win Europe’s top soccer competition. Keeping up his end of the bargain, Ronaldo scored both goals for Juventus over the two legs, but it wasn’t enough to progress. This goes to show that money can't win championships.<br><br>
      Who is at fault for the crash out of the champions league? Obviously Ronaldo is getting a lot of heat from fans about the loss, but he is clearly not the one to blame. The problem with Juventus is that they can't seem to close off a game, they are always choking. And it doesn't help that they have no competition in the domestic league. It could be that they've gotten complicit in the league and therefore just don't have the edge it takes to win a Champions League trophy.<br><br>
      I don't see Ronaldo leaving anytime soon from Juventus, not until he has done what he came to Juventus to do - win a CL trophy.
