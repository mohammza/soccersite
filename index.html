		<h2>What is this website?</h2>
		<p style="width: 90%; text-align: center;">
			Growing up I have always had a passion for soccer, it was the one thing that I truly had a burning passion. So it only made sense that I explore that passion and make a website for myself where I can express my opinions about the current events happen in soccer around the world. This website is a sports site that is dedicated to the UEFA Champions League. But more importantly it is a space where where I can express my opinions and views on certain matters. Feel free to go directly to <a href="blog.html">my blog page</a>.
		</p>
		<p style="width: 90%; text-align: center;">
			If you're not into soccer, I would still recommend going through the site and enjoying the content, hopefully it'll inspire you to try out soccer and get to know what people describe as <strong>"the beautiful game"</strong>.
