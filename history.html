				<p><strong>BEGINNINGS</strong></p>
				<p>
					&nbsp&nbspLike many other important events, this competition was conceived in Paris in 1955. The first name which the Champions League took on was the "European Cup". The very first edition took place during the 1955-56 season, in which sixteeen teams participated: Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgarden (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrucken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Stade de Reims (France), and Voros Lobogo (Hungary). The final of this first competition saw Real Madrid lift the trophy, the finale was fought between Stade de Riem and Real Madrid. Subsequently, Real Madrid would go on to win the next 4 titles of the competition until they are finally dethroned in the 1960-61 season after they were eliminated by their bitter rivals FC Barcelona. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp&nbspThe competition has been won by 22 clubs, 12 of which have won it more than once.Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 13 times, including its first five seasons. Real Madrid are also the reigning champions; they defeated Liverpool 3-1 in the 2018 final and became the first team in the Champions League era to win the title for three years in a row. Spanish clubs have the highest number of victories (18 wins), followed by England and Italy (12 wins apiece). England has the largest number of winning teams, with five clubs having won the title.

				<p><strong>UEFA CL ANTHEM</strong></p>		
				<p>
					&nbsp&nbspThe anthem is one of the most iconic part of the champions league. I'm sure all those who watch the Champions League sing it at the top of your lungs when it comes on (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbsk5qibSuM">relevant video</a>). In fact UEFA even states, <i>"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy."</i> Well here's some history behind the iconic song. It was written in 1992 by Tony Britten, a British composer. The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French. The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Equipes! The Champions!'
